OverDraw
===

OverDraw is a LaTeX2e Package that allows one to superimpose LaTeX on a drawing.
The GitHub Repository is set to show the latest stable build at master branch.
At this moment, the latest build is VERSION 0.1, which is stable but limited in
ability. If a previous release is required, access the [release][1] tab.
Current developments will be uploaded to the `developing` branch. Contributions
are always welcome, but Pull Requests directly to the `master` branch will not
be accepted.

OverDraw is still under development without a clear-cut agenda, so stay tuned!
