\section{The Basics : A Simple Sample Output}
The $\beta$-test version of this package only utilises what would have been the
parameters of \texttt{\\includegraphics} and what would have been TikZ commands
for drawing and typing various shapes and strings in a \texttt{tikzpicture}
environment. The following is a sample example:

\begin{center} \begin{overdraw}{Manual_Subfiles/Sample.jpg}[scale=0.2]
    \draw[blue,ultra thick,rounded corners] (0.65,0.58) rectangle (0.74,0.88);
\end{overdraw} \end{center}

This is a basic example of the environment \texttt{overdraw} with a sample image
from the repository. The most basic form of this environment takes an image as
a mandatory argument and its optional argument as optional afterwards. Source
code for this example is given below:

\begin{minted}{latex}
\begin{overdraw}{Manual_Subfiles/Sample.jpg}[scale=0.2]
    \draw[blue,ultra thick,rounded corners] (0.65,0.58) rectangle (0.74,0.88);
\end{overdraw}
\end{minted}

Grids can be drawn over this example to help end user experience when drawing
over the images:

\begin{center} \begin{griddraw}{Manual_Subfiles/Sample.jpg}[scale=0.2]
    \draw[blue,ultra thick,rounded corners] (0.65,0.58) rectangle (0.74,0.88);
\end{griddraw} \end{center}

This is a basic example of the environment \texttt{griddraw} with the sample
image from above.

\textit{Due to limited time, this manual is posted without sufficient guidance
or explanation as to the abilities and limits of this package. More and thorough
explanation will be given in version 0.2.}
